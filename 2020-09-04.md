# Extending Native Browser Capabilities with WebAssembly

- [ ] Premise: Performance of WASM is probably comparable to native code
  - [ ] Let's check it by implementing a bunch of benchmarks
    - [ ] Prime Number Crunching
      - [ ] [Native C Implementation](./main.c)
      - [ ] WebAssembly Implemention
- [ ] Idea: Let's imagine we invented a new image format that didn't exist before
  - [ ] If we implement the image support in WASM can we make it feel like a native browser support
