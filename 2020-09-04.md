# Extending Native Browser Capabilities with WebAssembly

- [ ] Premise: Performance of WASM is probably comparable to native code
  - [ ] Let's check it by implementing a Prime Number Crunching as a "Benchmark":
    - [x] [Native C Implementation](./main.c)
    - [ ] WebAssembly Implemention
- [ ] Idea: Let's imagine we invented a new image format that didn't exist before
  - [ ] If we implement the image support in WASM can we make it feel like a native browser support
