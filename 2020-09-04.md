# Extending Native Browser Capabilities with WebAssembly

- [ ] Premise: Performance of WASM is probably comparable to native code
  - [ ] Let's check it by implementing a Prime Number Crunching as a "Benchmark":
    - [x] [Native C Implementation](./main.c)
      ```console
        $ time ./prime
        179424673

        real    0m52.964s
        user    0m52.766s
        sys     0m0.196s
      ```
    - [x] [JavaScript Implementation](./prime-naive.js)
      ```console
        $ time node prime-naive.js
        179424673

        real    2m4.781s
        user    2m4.414s
        sys     0m0.208s
      ```
    - [x] [WebAssembly Implemention](./prime.wat)
      ```console
        $ time node prime-wasm.js
        179424673

        real    1m17.061s
        user    1m16.844s
        sys     0m0.192s
      ```
- [ ] Idea: Let's imagine we invented a new image format that didn't exist before
  - [ ] If we implement the image support in WASM can we make it feel like a native browser support
